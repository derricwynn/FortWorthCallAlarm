# C# FortWorthCallAlarm
my FIRST program ever! this program scans the taskmanager to see if a process is running and if not it sounds an alarm!

SCENARIO:  The call center recently upgraded all PCs to windows 10. As a result, the Cisco softphone they use randomly crashes with no error messages.  As a result CSR's sit idle at their desk with no idea they have been logged out of the softphone. 

IMPACT:  With Customer Service reps sitting idle not logged into the softphone, customers/residents are unable to call the City call center because the entire call center is logged off the soft phones.  

SOLUTION:  Create an application that will Audibly notify the CSRs with an alarm when the softphone crashes. CSR once alerted will log back into the softphone and continue taking calls for the City.
